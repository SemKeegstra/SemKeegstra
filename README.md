## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a quantitative researcher for a systematic equity fund covering developed markets. My responsibilities span both
research and development:
- **Research**: improving the investment strategy via in-depth research on asset pricing, risk management, 
portfolio construction and performance analysis.
- **Development**: design, development, implementation and maintenance of the code infrastructure that is required within
the team to effectively perform research.

In addition to my professional experience, I have a strong passion for quantitative finance and programming, which 
extends beyond my day-to-day work. As a result, I have developed my own private code base to support my research
on systematic investment strategies.

- 🔭 **Current Focus**:
  - *Research*: Trade delays & indirect exposure to short-term signals.
  - *Development*: Building the `Quant-Finance` python library.
- 📚 **Recent readings**:
    - The Elements of Quantitative Investing - Paleologo, G. A.
    - Advanced in Financial Machine Learning - De Prado, M. L.
- 💼 **Programming & Tools**:  
  - Python, Matlab, Java, R
  - Axioma Portfolio Optimizer
  - Azure DevOps, Git, SQL
  - Dash, Streamlit, Sphinx, LaTex
